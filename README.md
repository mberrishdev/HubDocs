- üìù **Method Documentation**: Shows method signatures, parameters, and return types
- üé® **Beautiful UI**: Swagger-inspired dark theme interface

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package HubDocs
```

## Quick Start

1. Add HubDocs to your ASP.NET Core application:

```csharp
using HubDocs;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
// ... your other configurations ...

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure HubDocs middleware
app.AddHubDocs(typeof(ChatHub).Assembly, typeof(NotificationHub).Assembly);

// ... your other middleware configurations ...
```

2. Access the HubDocs UI at `/hubdocs/index.html`

## Example

Here's a simple example of how HubDocs displays your SignalR hubs:

```csharp
public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
        await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
    }

    public async Task JoinRoom(string roomName)
    {
        await Groups.AddToGroupAsync(Context.ConnectionId, roomName);
    }
}
```

HubDocs will automatically discover this hub and display:
- The hub name and full type name
- All public methods with their parameters and return types
- A beautiful, interactive UI to explore the hub

## Configuration

HubDocs is designed to work out of the box with minimal configuration. However, you can customize it by passing specific assemblies to scan:

```csharp
// Scan specific assemblies
app.ConfigureMiddleware(
    typeof(Hub1).Assembly,
    typeof(Hub2).Assembly
);
```
